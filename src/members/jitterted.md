JitterTed (aka Ted M. Young) is a software developer who has been coding, training, and coaching in Java for 25 years. He helps individual developers and teams improve the quality of their code by making it more testable through custom online training workshops and virtual coaching.

Ted streams working on a variety of projects, from his "Kid Money Manager" product, to his learning site (quiz generation), as well as smaller projects for use in training (simple games like Blackjack and Yahtzee) and tools for his streaming (overlays, bots). As much as possible, Ted uses Test-Driven Development techniques and approaches the code from a real-world perspective where code quality and architecture matters.
