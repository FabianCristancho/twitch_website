Hi! My name is Saint or Kobe for the regulars.

I stream JS-based coding challenges and projects twice a week with the occasional gaming.
I'm also one of the co-founders for DisStreamChat, a chat tool for anyone that uses twitch.

I've been programming for a few years but am still a student with a goal to do development professionally
