Frank Boucher, was born on the French side of this wide Canadian county. Passionate about the Cloud he started sharing with a first blog in French, and shortly after, a second one in English.

Since then, he created the “Cloud 5 minutes” show. Where every second week, a new episode that answers a different technical question, is published both in French and English [cloud5mins.com](http://cloud5mins.com/).

He loves streaming to try different things, new technology and build open-source projects with the community.

When he needs to recharge, while hiking or kayaking he enjoys taking a moment to pursue his passion, photography... and of course will share the best shots on Instagram.
