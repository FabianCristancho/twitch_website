Hello, My name is Seekaplayer. I'm a Gamer, Streamer, Content Creator and Web Designer/Developer. I love what I do and I love learning new things all the time. I've always enjoy technology and growing up I found I had a keen interest in learning how technology worked. I started building websites with WYSIWYG builders and then a friend of mine taught me HTML and CSS. Once I started learning Web Design/Development I wanted to learn more, so I obtained my Bachelor's of Science in Communications Technology majoring in Web Media.

I've always enjoy Twitch and had always wanted to stream so I started streaming Game play (League of Legends, Battlefield, Call of Duty) and then I found the [Science and Technology](https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Science%20%26%20Technology) category on Twitch. I started streaming myself learning code and my life changed from there. I achieved Twitch Affiliate on October 2017 and I joined with the Live Coders team in August 2019. Since then I've met some of the most talented individuals I've ever met and I've made some really great friends. I've had a chance to go to TwitchCon and meet other streamers/Live Coders Team Members.

If you love Technology and you enjoy learning new things then I invite you to come check out my [Twitch Channel](https://twitch.tv/seekaplayer). Also if you're interested in streaming you should! It's an amazing experience! Also if you're interested in joining the Live Coders Team then please feel free to [Apply](https://github.com/livecoders/Home/issues/new?assignees=csharpfritz&labels=application&template=application.md&title=Application+for+Membership).
