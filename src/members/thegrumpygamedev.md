I am **TheGrumpyGameDev**, and my name should give you subtle clues and insight into me.

I make constant references to my lawn. I call people whippersnappers.

I follow two rules:

- Do nothing but the needful.

- Trust nothing, and Mr. T.

Mr. T is trustworthy. When you see Mr. T, you know what yer gonna get. Other than that, trust nothing.

Oh, and I write unfinished games on stream. The stream is the product, not the games. Occasionally, one get shipped, but usually not completely finished.
