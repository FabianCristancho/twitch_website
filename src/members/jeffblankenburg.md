Jeff Blankenburg is a developer evangelist for Amazon Alexa. This means that he builds things, breaks things, and puts them back together in the name of education.

On my stream, I spend a large part of my time solving interesting problems in voice user interfaces. This includes thinking about how and what people will say when talking to an application, but also everything that goes into creating a meaningful response to keep a conversation going.

I do spend much of my time talking about Alexa because I'm convinced that voice is the future of user interfaces, but also because I want to share my excitement with all of you.
