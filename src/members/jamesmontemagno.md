Every day I crush code and share it with the world, publish NuGet packages, speak at conferences, upload videos, live stream coding, tweet up a storm, drink gallons of coffee, and ride my bike around this beautiful city of Seattle.

I'm James Montemagno, and I work on the mobile developer tools team of a small company that you may have heard of called Microsoft. My primary focus is on ensuring a delightful experience for developers using Xamarin to build mobile applications in C# for iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.
