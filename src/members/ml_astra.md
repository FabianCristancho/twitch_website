# Hello There!

I'm Morgan _"Astra"_ Lewis, a limey brit thats short a few bits. I tend to bounce form project and language to language as I have ADD making it hard to concentrate on one project for a long burst so every stream will have a variety of languages, projects, accents, and jokes.

I hail originally from the west coast of England so keep and ear out for some odd sayings and pronunciations. Nowadays though I reside in one of the biggest port cities in the UK and my word does it get ever busy!

Hope to see you out there in cyberspace, wherever in the world you connect from! It'll be an honour to meet you ðŸ¦Š
