Hi There! My name is Jeremy Morgan, and I'm the world's okayest developer. I stream mostly about C#/.NET stuff, and also Go and Python. If you hop on my stream there's an equal chance you'll see a Windows 11, Mac, or Linux desktop. 

I try to make my streams educational, and sometimes I'm just fumbling around and having fun with friends. I don't take myself too seriously and I don't ever intend to be a rock star streamer influencer. This is all just for fun. 

Thanks for checking out my profile, connect with me and let's be friends.
