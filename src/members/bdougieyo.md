Brian is a Developer Advocate at GitHub and the host of the JAMstack Radio podcast. He focuses his day to day work on JavaScript development. He previously had a career in sales before turning to his true love, coding. After quickly honing his engineering skills he has since worked as both engineer and mentor to others also looking to make a similar career change.

This stream is a place where I can keep up to date with JavaScript frameworks while learning new infrastructure and maybe game developer things.

Please join the chat and say !yo.
