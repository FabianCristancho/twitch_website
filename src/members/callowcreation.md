I pride myself on being an outstanding developer, who believes in achieving a goal as efficiently as possible. I enjoy solving problems as my hobbies, designing and building electronic circuits, and computer programming may imply also I am a self-published poet; creating things is so much fun. I want to learn as much as I can while Iâ€™m alive and teach it. This attitude translates into my job performance.

I am a Detail-oriented, organized, and meticulous engineer with over 10 years of experience in professional software development, delivering products to customers and end-users.
