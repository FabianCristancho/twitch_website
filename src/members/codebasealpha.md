Hi, I'm Essenbee (aka Stu Bonham), host of the Codebase Alpha stream. I've been a developer or more years than I care to remember, and am currently a development manager who's very hands on with the code. My stream is beginner-friendly, by which I don't mean it has a "learn to code" agenda; but rather one that covers topics like creating a secure web API from scratch, creating a Spectrum 48K emulator, or coding an Alexa Skill, without assuming any prior knowledge of those topics. My main motivations for streaming are to challenge myself and to give something back to the developer community in my own small way. Although I mainly code using the Microsoft .NET stack, both professionally and on stream, the projects I tackle on Codebase Alpha are a world away from those I work on as a professional developer.
