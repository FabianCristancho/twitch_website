As a former Pilates teacher and professional horse-rider, Layla changed careers and became a self-taught .NET developer. Microsoft technologies and the support of people using it became her new passion. Layla is a Microsoft MVP, she organises the .NET user group in Milton Keynes and helps developers all over the world as a Twilio developer evangelist.
