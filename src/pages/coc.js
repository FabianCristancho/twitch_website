      </ul>
      <h2>Integrity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our reputation as a positive, engaging, and helpful team is our most
          valuable asset. It is up to each of us to make sure we continually
          work to maintain that reputation. All of our actions, with each other,
          and while we represent our team in other environments should increase
          our reputation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Drugs and Alcohol</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you are of legal age to consume alcohol where you reside, feel free
          to drink alcohol, but please use good judgement and never drink in a
          way that leads to inappropriate behavior, endangers your life or the
          safety of others, violates the Live Coders Code of Conduct, violates
          ToS, or the law.
        </li>
        <li>
          Even if you reside in a state/country with legal marijuana, please
          refrain from smoking on camera.

          (positively or negatively) about our Discord or the team in general,
          please contact our Community Manager LilyHazel.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will do our best to address concerns, sugestions, and feedback in a
          timely manner.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Twitch ToS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          We, as a team, must adhere to Twitch ToS (find ToS here:{" "}
          <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/">
            https://www.twitch.tv/p/legal/terms-of-service/
          </a>
          )
        </li>
        <li>
          Failure to do so may not only result in a warning/ban from Twitch, but
          will also result in a dismissal from the Live Coders team.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2> Harassment/Bullying/Discrimination </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Support each other!! Members are expected to create a culture that is
          free of harassment, intimidation, bias and discrimination.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Live Coders team prohibits any form of discrimination, harassment,
          and bullying - verbal, physical, or visual. If you feel that you have
          been bullied or harassed by anyone on the Live Coders team,
          immediately reach out to Community Manager LilyHazel with as much
          information as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Members who report a harassment or bullying incident will NOT face
          retaliation from the Live Coders team.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a member is found to engage in harassing, bullying or
          discriminatory behavior, they will be put on a 30 day mute for the
          first offense (unless this is a severe incident, for which they may be
          banned). Meaning they will remain in the Discord, but won't be able to
          chat in any of the channels. After this period they will be unmuted,
          and can fully engage in the Discord once more.
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on the severity of the 2nd incident, the member may be
          removed from the Discord for a 30 day period and re-invited after, OR,
          if the incident was severe enough, the member will be removed from the
          team AND prohibited from re-applying.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Conflicts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Arguments will happen, people disagree, it's normal. However, if an
          argument escalates to a point of creating actual conflict, LilyHazel
          will act as mediator.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you feel someone crossed a line, made you feel uncomfortable, or
          you need any other form of conflict mediation, please reach out to
          Community Manager LilyHazel with as much detail as you can provide.
        </li>
        <li>There will be NO retaliation against a member making a report.</li>
        <li>
          If your conflict happens to be with our Community Manager LilyHazel or
          you don't feel comfortable reaching out to her, please direct your
          report to CSharpFritz.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Appealing Dismissals/Bans from the Live Coders team</h2>
